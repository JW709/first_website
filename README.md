# first_website

Welcome to my fictional band page! This is my first project for my web-dev bootcamp and the first web-page I ever made. 

The stack is simple - HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery.
I was pretty pumped with the collapsable side-nav I made, other than that I love how imperfect it is.
